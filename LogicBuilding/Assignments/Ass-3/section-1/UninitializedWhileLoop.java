// Error to investigate: Why does this code produce a compilation error? 

--->whenever write a condition in while loop aur any loops first the initialize the variable


UninitializedWhileLoop.java:4: error: variable count might not have been initialized
 while (count < 10) {
        ^
1 error


What needs to be done to initialize the loop variable properly?

--> once  get the initialization done then the compiler knows to the value of that variable
