// Error to investigate: Why does "Done" print only once, outside the loop? 

--->we dont give the curly braces for for loop so Done is printed 
on console scrren by only once  java MisplacedForLoopBody
0
1

4
Done

How should the loop body be enclosed to include all statements within the loop?

--> inside the curly braces of for loop
