// Error to investigate: What is the issue with the loop boundaries? 

--> here i is initialize to 1 but until condition is <= less than is equal to so the last number 10 is also print on the console screeen


 How should the loop be adjusted to meet the expected output? 
 
 --> jus delete the = equal to sign in condition part
