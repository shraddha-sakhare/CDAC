Question 4: Discount Calculation 


Write a program to calculate the discount based on the total purchase amount. 

Use the following 
criteria: 

 If the total purchase is greater than or equal to Rs.1000, apply a 20% discount. 
 If the total purchase is between Rs.500 and Rs.999, apply a 10% discount. 
 If the total purchase is less than Rs.500, apply a 5% discount.
Additionally, if the user has a membership card, increase the discount by 5%.
