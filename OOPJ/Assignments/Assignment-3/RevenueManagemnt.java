5. Toll Booth Revenue Management 
Develop a system to simulate a toll booth for collecting revenue. The system should: 
1. Allow the user to set toll rates for different vehicle types: Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. 
2. Accept the number of vehicles of each type passing through the toll booth. 
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the toll rates and number of vehicles. 
4. Display the total number of vehicles and the total revenue collected, in Indian Rupees 
(₹). 
Toll Rate Examples: 
Car: ₹50.00 
Truck: ₹100.00 
Motorcycle: ₹30.00 
ASSIGNMENT NO.3 
Define class TollBoothRevenueManager with methods 
acceptRecord, setTollRates, calculateRevenue & printRecord and test the functionality in 
main method
