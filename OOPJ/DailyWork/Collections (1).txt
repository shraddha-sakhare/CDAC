Collections
-------------

Collection framework provides various classes/interfaces.
Each collection class is known as container class.
We can create object of container class i.e. container object
That container object will contain a no. of data in terms of objects.
Collection can store only objects and not primitive data.

All the collection classes/interfaces are available in java.util package.
Collection class container stores references of the object.

ArrayList
----------
interface A;
class B implements A;

A ref = new B();

List -- interface
ArrayList implements List

List<String> strList1 = new ArrayList<String>();		//OK
List<String> strList1 = new ArrayList<>();			//OK


------------------------------------

List  
- Stores data in ordered way. Indexed based operation is possible. It can contain duplicate values. It can contain multiple null values.

Queue
- First In First Out

Set
- It can not contain duplicate values.
- It can have maximum one null value.

Map
- It stores data in key-value pair

Collections
- An utility class which is used for Collection classes (ArrayList, LinkedList etc.)

Arrays
- An utility class which is used for normal array.


Iterator can be used for the classes which implements Iterable interface.,

for-each, Iterator, Enumeration these are used to iterate only Collection objects and not for Map.

Set - HashSet
Collection interface - methods
List interface - methods

Input => String str = "abxayya";
Output => a b x y
